# CSAW-M_Annotation_Tool
This is the repo for the annotation tool developed to annotate [_CSAW-M: An Ordinal Classification Dataset for Benchmarking Mammographic Masking of Cancer_](https://openreview.net/forum?id=nlJ1rV6G_Iq). Code for training models on CSAW-M could be found [here](https://github.com/yueliukth/CSAW-M). In order to generally understand how the tool is organized, please refer to Section "CSAW-M dataset creation" of our paper.
